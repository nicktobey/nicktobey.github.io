*I need to start things off by acknowledging that just because I can say what I want doesn't mean that my words have any value. I don't know what it's like to fear for my life based on my race or how I present myself. All I can do is look toward my role models who do know what it's like, and understand their experiences, their fears and their judgments. In polarizing times like this, I look to Majiid Nawaz, the founder of the Quillam anti-extremism think tank, and a former Muslim extremist who is now leading the charge on deradicalization movements. I found what he had to say about the election very informative, and I am echoing his fears. Of course, he speaks much better than I can, and draws from his own pivotal experience, so if you're going to read one blog post about this, you should read his instead:*

*(And then go read his memoir if you haven't because it's fascinating and quite possibly the most relevant book out there on combating extremism.)*

The day after Election Day, two close friends came to me for support. Once of them was a black trans woman who was being harassed in her own neighborhood. The other was white, an outspoken Christian on a college campus, who felt alienated by her entire campus. Both felt isolated and afraid. In a country so divided in the wake of perhaps the most polarizing US election in living memory, the one thing that could unite us was our sense of foreboding.

I've already been told that by drawing this parallel, I'm establishing a false equivalency and underplaying the dire circumstances faced by the minority groups Trump has in his sights. One of my co-workers proudly proclaimed:  "I'll save my sympathy for his victims, not his supporters." But fuck me, because I'm not going to save my sympathy. Not in this climate.

Right now, there's an ongoing discussion I'm hearing from my friends and coworkers: about whether it is acceptable to deride and ostracize people who voted for Donald Trump in the general election. I've witnessed several people express that they do not feel safe in Silicon Valley after admitting they supported Trump, that, as the local parlance goes, they can't "bring their whole selves to work." And the general response from the predominantly liberal population of the Bay Area, seems to be: "Good. You deserve it. Now you know how we feel."

This attitude isn't really surprising. It's the end result of a gradual process of polarization in America, mixed with the attitude that says that the correct response to political adversity is mockery and scorn. This retreat into ridicule is all around us, from the ad-hominem attacks about Trump's tiny hands, to the half-serious, wishful-thinking theory that maybe Trump's entire election run has been an elaborate prank. And when someone at the bar or the office whips out a snide comment or joke about him, there's an intense pressure to play along, lest the mood be spoiled.

But to convert that contempt to derision, to mockery, does nothing but make us feel slightly better about ourselves. And to everyone who is trying to combat fear with levity right now (a group that includes myself), I don't blame them. We deserve to feel safe. We deserve to be able to approach sensitive discussions in a way that makes us comfortable. But we don't deserve Trump either, and yet here he is. So what are we going to do now?

Approximately 60 million people voted for Donald Trump on Tuesday. That's nearly one fifth of the entire population of the United States. And everyone who voted for Trump did so for a reason. By necessity, I likely disagree with every single one of those reasons, and I likely find many of them morally reprehensible. But these voters are people whose votes were influenced by fears and concerns. These fears may not have been validated, but were real.

And so, having considered that, we (American liberals) have two options:

1) We decide that one-fifth of the American population is beyond saving, not worthy of moral consideration.

2) We ask ourselves what those fears and reasons are.

We tried option 1 for this election. Media personalities like John Oliver and John Stewart mocked Trump unendingly. And I was on board with this, because Trump deserves to be mocked. And in hindsight, the outcome of this was inevitable. We corroborated the narrative that the media was stacked against Trump, a narrative that no doubt galvanized many of his voters. And how do you win an election after insulting and alienating 20% of the population? You can't.

Those on the left don't know what it's like to be a Trump supporter who feels left behind by globalization and snubbed by the "elite liberal media". Just as the majority of Trump supporters don't know what it's like to be a minority who feels threatened by Trump's many threats, or a woman fearing that her access to important reproductive healths services will be compromised. And we don't know because we don't ask. It's easier to write people off as racist or a "justice warrior", declare that it's not our responsibility to change them, and be satisfied that at least we are the ones on the right side of history. And can argue until we die about whether or not it's our responsibility to educate the people who disagree with us politically, or whether they should "go educate themselves". But ultimately, who has "responsibility" doesn't change our options, and what the consequences of those options are. We could argue about whether or not our political rivals deserve contempt, but what they deserve isn't nearly as important as the tangible results of our election process, and harassing them now is cutting off the nose to spite the face.

(This is another trend, a tendency for media figures on the left to be more concerned about "being good" than "doing good". That is not the topic of this post, although it was undeniably a contributing factor in this election cycle. Every time John Oliver made a joke about Trump's tiny hands with the presumption that everyone in the audience would laugh along, he contributed, if only a little bit, to the increasing polarization and distrust of the media, and we were too busy laughing to notice.)

I've already been called a concern troll for this, and told that I need to stop protecting white fragility. Let's get one thing straight: I don't give a damn about the fragile egos of the alt-right. The alt-right is a hate group already connected with terrorist plots, and I will vehemently argue with anyone who would condone their behavior this election cycle. Saying that we need to understand the fears and concerns of Trump supporters is *not* saying that we condone their choices, is *not* saying to go soft on our political opponents. We should not stop criticizing them and attempting to educate them. If anything. it's a call to go harder, but to work in ways that will be impactful and resonant with the people we address, and not just ourselves.

So how do we address Trump supporters, knowing that some (not all, some) are angry, lashing out, and sympathetic to violence? Well, how do we treat groups like ISIS? It's well accepted in liberal circles that we should be attempting to stop their recruitment and radicalization, and that in order to do so we need to understand the motivations that cause people to join these groups. We acknowledge that empathizing is not the same as condoning. That, if we want to get oversimplified and trite, we will win this war with love, not hate. Why then, do we not apply this philosophy to domestic groups?

It's easy enough to refuse to engage them except on our terms, because they don't deserve our time. But these people vote, as they should in a democracy. And because these people vote, Donald Trump was democratically elected president of the United States. In this sense, democracy prevailed. It is us, the outspoken liberals of America, who have failed. And we need to be willing to question why that is.

Insanity is repeating the same action and expecting a different result. Thus, doubling down on the way we currently communicate with the right is insanity.  I'm not saying Trump isn't a racist and a mysoginist (he is), I'm not saying we shouldn't call out racism and mysoginy where we see it (we should), and I'm not saying that the people who defended his attitudes and wrote off his behavior shouldn't be held in contempt (they should). Of course we should continue to protest, to do our best to make our grievances known. We should never stop trying to inform others about the pernicious ills of institutionalized implicit racism and sexism, of which Donald Trump is practically a satirical embodiment of. But we need to recognize that the way we relate to the right does not work. Because Donald Trump is not a satire. He's real, and serious, and we need to take him seriously.

So, I say this to anyone who is feeling disenfranchised, frightened, or upset by this election season, for whatever reason: my door is open. And I ask that everyone else do the same. Because once we decide that "empathy is abhorrent," there really is no going back.
